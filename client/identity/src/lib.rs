//! An identity that no server issues.
//!
//! A person IS their root key. Their directory entry - name, root, recovery
//! key, the devices allowed to sign for them - is a document they sign
//! themselves. Boxes only store and relay it. A box can withhold an entry or
//! serve a stale one; it cannot produce a valid newer one, because it holds no
//! key that could sign it.
//!
//! Two keys, on purpose. The root key signs everything day to day and lives
//! on the person's devices. The recovery key lives on paper: it can sign
//! exactly one thing, an entry that installs a new root - so a lost or stolen
//! device is survivable without any server or person standing in for you.
//!
//! Or one key: an account made in a browser has a passkey for a root
//! (`webauthn:<credential id>`), and the entry is signed by a webauthn
//! assertion whose challenge is the entry's hash. No device key, no paper;
//! the passkey platform's sync is the recovery. Every box checks it the
//! same way and none can make one: the authenticator signs, the box only
//! asked.
