# A game server is an instance of a template, made at run time by a member
# through the manager, and neither a deploy nor a reboot loses it. Here the
# "game" is a web server, so nothing is fetched from steam: a member asks for
# one, the guest boots and serves on the port it was given, a switch leaves
# its process alone, a reboot brings it back with its world, another member
# cannot touch it, and a stop is a clean one.
