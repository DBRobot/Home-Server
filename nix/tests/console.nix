# The way in at the keyboard. A box that loses its network still has a
# monitor and a keyboard, and until now it had nothing else: admin was
# made with no password and kept it, because nixos writes a declarative
# password only for a user it is creating unless users are immutable.
# On a real box the hash comes from sops before users are made
# (roles/core.nix); what this proves is the half that was wrong, which is
# that a hashedPasswordFile reaches /etc/shadow at all.
