//! The agent: a box moves itself to the release, and to nothing else.
//!
//! Runs from a timer. Fetches the release file, checks it is signed by the
//! release key this box was installed with, refuses a counter lower than
//! the last one it applied, looks up its own entry, fetches that closure,
//! checks the nar hash, switches, and proves the box is still a box: no
//! failed units, sshd listening, the verifier answering. If that fails
//! within the window the previous system comes back. Nothing here accepts
//! a push; the only input is a signed file and the only authority is the
//! key that signed it.
//!
//! bin/deploy, inverted: the same steps, started by the box.
